# 💧 Maji Ndogo – Water Access Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard analyzes and visualizes access to clean water in the fictional region of **Maji Ndogo**. It models real-world infrastructure challenges by integrating multiple datasets to help identify where improvements are needed, how they’ll impact residents, and how cost-effective the upgrades are.
