🔹 Overview
This Power BI dashboard presents a deep-dive analysis into water access improvements in the fictional region of Maji Ndogo. The project simulates real-world public sector data challenges — integrating multiple datasets to inform development strategy, resource allocation, and impact estimation.

🔹 Objectives
Identify current access levels to clean water

Track planned infrastructure upgrades

Estimate the impact of improvements on people’s lives

Calculate cost efficiency (e.g., cost per citizen)

Create an interactive bookmark-driven dashboard for decision-makers

🔹 Key Metrics & Features
Basic Water Access %
Real-time metric showing the proportion of the population with reliable and clean water access.

Lives Improved % (Projected)
A custom DAX measure estimating the percentage of people who will gain access due to planned improvements.

Cost per Citizen
Dynamic calculation of how much each upgrade is costing per individual served — helps track value-for-money.

Bookmark Navigation
Users can toggle between “Province View” and “Improvement View” using clean, image-based buttons powered by bookmarks and the selection pane.

🔹 Technical Highlights
Data modeling across multiple related tables (water_source, project_progress, infrastructure_cost, location)

Advanced DAX measures for projection, conditional logic, and ratio calculations

Use of transparent buttons + bookmarks to create a seamless UI toggle experience

Dashboard formatted for clarity, storytelling, and real-time exploration

🔹 Tools Used
Power BI Desktop

DAX for custom calculations

Bookmarks and selection pane for interactivity

GitHub + Google Sites for publishing

🔹 Impact
This project showcases how clear data modeling and DAX logic can help governments and NGOs:

Prioritize infrastructure investment

Estimate social return on upgrades

Present insights in an accessible, visual way
